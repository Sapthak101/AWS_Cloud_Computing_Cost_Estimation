# AWS_Cloud_Computing_Cost_Estimation
Creating a demo cost chart for a project based dedicated workloads (Lab Work)

Project Prompt

Lab overview and objectives:
This hands-on lab guides you through the steps to estimate Amazon Web Services (AWS) costs for a sample workload. The workload that you evaluate is for a three-tier web application that consists of an Application Load Balancer, an Amazon EC2 instance, and an Amazon RDS instance. The skills that you learn will help you use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs for your workloads.

Summary:
In this lab, you created a cost estimate using AWS Pricing Calculator. You added the components that are required for a three-tier web application and defined the sizing requirements for each service. You previewed the annual cost estimate and generated a link to share the estimate with others. 

Now, you know how to evaluate the potential costs of architectures before you deploy them. This helps you control your AWS costs and avoid unpleasant surprises such as unexpected or high monthly bills.

This is only for demonstration purpose.
